        Solar panels can save you money on your energy bills by generating electricity from the sun. Solar energy is  a clean and renewable source of energy. Solar panels can help you become more energy independent by generating your own electricity. This can be a great option if you live in an area that is prone to power outages. Studies have shown that homes with solar panels sell for more money than homes without solar panels.
